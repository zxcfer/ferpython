Even with no-code, building a new app can be time-consuming. Planning and setting up data sources, designing an intuitive user interface, and ensuring bug-free app logic all require careful attention and testing.

However, AI can speed up the initial steps of app creation by automatically setting up database schemas, a basic user interface, and essential app logic. This allows developers to focus on more critical aspects of their app. After testing various options, here are the best AI app builders available.

While the initial setup may take a few moments, the Softr editor provides a dashboard, login pages, data display, and input forms. Users can easily configure the appearance and behavior of each component and connect data storage platforms like Google Sheets or Airtable.
