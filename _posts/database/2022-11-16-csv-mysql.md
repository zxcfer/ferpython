To load data from a CSV file you can just execute the following SQL command:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE "/home/fer/data.csv"
INTO TABLE __TABLE__
COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
ESCAPED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

Additionally, you can add IGNORE statement after filename to ignore errors

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE "/home/fer/data.csv" IGNORE
...
```

In the case you are running MySQL server with `--secure-file-priv ` option, you will get an error. To fix this, you can execute the following query:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";
```

Then you have to move your csv file into the directory shown in `secure-file-priv`, otherwise, you have to restart MySQL with `secure-file-priv` disabled.
