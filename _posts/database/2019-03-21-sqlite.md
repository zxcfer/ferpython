# SQLite cheatsheet

## Advantages

* Extremely lightweight
* Compatible SQL, not 100% but enough
* Ideal as in-app database

## Disadvantages

* Lack of multi-user capabilities, roles.
* Writes are serialized, so it's not suited for large databases.
* Concurrency not possible.
* Not good for large application.

## Data Types

There are only 5 types in SQLite:

- NULL. 
- INTEGER. Signed integer (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes)
- REAL. Floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
- TEXT. The value is a text string (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
- BLOB.

## Date and time

For storing date and time you can one of the following alternatives:

- TEXT. As ISO8601 strings `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"`.
- REAL. The number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C.
- INTEGER. As Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
