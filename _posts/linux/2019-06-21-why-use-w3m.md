# Why use w3m?

W3m is one of the few command line browsers, the other is Lynx.

Now that there is so much javascript functionality in web pages, it sounds a bit crazy to use a command line browser. However, there are some special cases where it might make sense. Here I show you some:

1. The most obvious of all. You don't have a graphical GUI and you only have terminal access to a computer. Need to quickly see a website or copy some content, with w3m you can see it instantly, without having to leave your terminal window.
2. Need to know if they can see a website from a server that you only have access to through SSH.
3. Need to see if any content is loading without javascript. Since W3m does not support Javascript, it is a way of knowing if a website loads well without Javascript.

## Installing

* Ubuntu 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install w3m
```

* CentOS

```bash
sudo yum -y install w3m
```

## Usage

Execute with `w3m` or adding the URL you want to visit:

```bash
w3m -v https://google.com
```

While in w3m type `shift + h` for help, then /edit to search for edit, then n to find next occurrence of edit, you will soon find the answer you seek.

Type `shift` + `b` to go back to the page you were on.

Type o to get to the options window and change the default editor to vim.

- Exit: `q`

Config `~/.w3m/config`
